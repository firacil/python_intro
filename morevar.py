#as i said python hs no command for declaring variable.
# variable will be created at the moment we first assign a value to it.

#1 and now let's try additional thing on variable.

x = 5
x = "I am Not Five"

# what is the out put ??
#so, python can change type after they have been set.

print(x)

#2 Casting
#If i want to specify the data type of variable, this can be done with casting.

i = int(8)
j = float(8)
k = str(8)

print (i)
print (j)
print (k)

#try the output before excuting

#3 getting type of variable.
# to get type of variable we will use type() function.

l = 5
m = "Firaol"

print(type(l))
print (type(m))

#try the output before excution

#4 single and double quotes
# string variables can be declared using either single or double quotes

n = "Firaol"
# same as
o = 'Firaol'

#try to writedown outputs before excution

print(n)
print(o)

#5 Case-Sensitive
#variable names are case sensitive.

a = 90
A = 'ninty'

#this two variables is not the same a and A
#try outputs before excution

print(a)
print (A)
