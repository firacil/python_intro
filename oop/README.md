* Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects, which bundle data and the methods (functions) that operate on that data. This approach helps structure code, making it easier to manage, reuse, and understand.

## Key Concepts in OOP
### Class: A blueprint for creating objects.
### Object: An instance of a class.
### Attributes: Variables that store data for an object.
### Methods: Functions defined inside a ### class that describe the behaviors of an object.
### Inheritance: Allows one class to inherit attributes and methods from another.
### Encapsulation: Hiding the internal details of an object and exposing only whatâ€™s necessary.
### Polymorphism: Different objects can use the same method name in different ways.
